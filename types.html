  <h1>Vehicle Types, Car Body Styles </h1>

  <p>
    there are more than 400 different models and car types available
    trying</a> to figure out which one to buy might seem very difficult
    and confusing
    here are the major catogories covering all of the basic type of cars
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to define a vehicle is by how it looks. What's the first
    thing you notice when a vehicle comes toward you on the street? Its shape.
    That's called the "body style." Is it tall and boxy? Low and sleek?
    How many doors does it have? Body style is the easiest way to categorize
    a vehicle.

  <h2 id="sedan">Sedan</h2>
  <img class="sedan" src="images\pexels-mike-b-170811.jpg" alt="">

  <p>A sedan is a four door traditional car . They are the most common cars
    people drive around the worldLike vehicles in many categories,
    they're available in a range of sizes from small
    (subcompact vehicles like Nissan Versa and Kia Rio) to compacts
    (Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla) to mid-size (Honda Accord, Nissan Altima),
    and full-size (Toyota Avalon, Dodge Charger). Luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz
    and Lexus have sedans in similar sizes as well..
  </p>

  <h2 id="coupe">coupe</h2>
  <img src="images\coupe.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    coupes are known for being a 2 door car with a solid roof and a trunk.
    This would include cars like a Ford Mustang or Audi A5—or even two-seat
    sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche Boxster. Recently,
    however, car companies have started to apply the word "coupe" to four-door
    cars or crossovers with low, sleek rooflines that they deem "coupe-like."
    This includes vehicles as disparate as a Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan and BMW X6 SUV.
    At Car and Driver, we still consider a coupe to be a two-door car.

  <h2 id="sports">sports car</h2>
  <img src="images\sport.jpg" alt="">
  <p>These are the sportiest, hottest, coolest-looking coupes and convertibles—low to the ground,
    sleek, and often expensive. They generally are two-seaters, but sometimes have small rear
    seats as well. Cars like the Porsche 911 and Mazda Miata are typical sports cars,
    but you can stretch the definition to include muscle cars like the Ford Mustang
    and Dodge Challenger. Then there are the high-end exotic dream cars with sky-high
    price tags for the one percent, cars like the Ferrari 488 GTB and Aston Martin Vantage,
    which stop traffic with their spaceship looks.

  <h2 id="hatch">hatchback</h2>
  <img src=images\hatchback.jpg alt="">
  <p>
    Traditionally, the term "hatchback" has meant a compact or subcompact sedan
    with a squared-off roof and a rear flip-up hatch door that provides access to
    the vehicle's cargo area instead of a conventional trunk. The Volkswagen Golf
    and Kia Rio are two typical hatchbacks. More recently, rear hatches have found
    their way on to some larger cars, like the Audi A7 and Kia Stinger.
    They look like sedans, but they actually have a steeply raked hatchback that
    affords easier accessibility to the cargo area and greater carrying capacity
    than a traditional trunk would.

  <br><br>

  <h2 id="convertable">convertable</h2>
  <img src=images\convertable.jpg alt="">
  <p>
    Does the roof retract into the body leaving the passenger cabin open to the elements?
    If so, it's a convertible. Most convertibles have a fully powered fabric roof that
    folds down, but a few have to be lowered by hand. There are also a number of models
    with a retractable hardtop, as well as several unusual quasi-convertibles
    (called "targa tops") like the Mazda MX-5 Miata RF, Porsche 911 Targa and Corvette;
    only the forward section of their roofs retracts or can be removed by hand.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2 id="suv">sport-utility vehicle(SUV)</h2>
  <img src=images\suv.jpg alt="">
  <p>
    SUVs—often also referred to as crossovers—tend to be taller and boxier than sedans,
    offer an elevated seating position, and have more ground clearance than a car.
    They include a station wagon-like cargo area that is accessed through a flip-up
    rear hatch door, and many offer all-wheel drive. The larger ones have three rows of seats. Sizes start at subcompact (Hyundai Kona, Nissan Kicks), mid-size, and go all the way to full-size (Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe). Luxury brands offer
    many SUV models in most of the same size categories.

  <h2 id="mini">minivan</h2>

  <p>
    and cargo in an efficient package. They're called minivans but they are far from "mini."
    That's because they are tall boxes-on-wheels with sliding side doors for easy access and
    a rear hatch that opens to a large cargo area. Most minivans have adjustable
    seats in their second and third rows that often can be removed or even folded into
    the floor to create a huge open cargo bay. The Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Pacifica
    Minivans are the workhorses of the family-car world, the best at carrying people
    are great examples of the breed.

  <h2 id="truck">pick up truck</h2>
  <img src="images\pick up.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    A pickup truck has a passenger cab and an open cargo bed in the rear.
    Virtually all pickups offer some form of all-wheel drive or part-time
    four-wheel drive—the latter for off-road use only. With one exception—the
    mid-sized Honda Ridgeline—pickup bodies are cabs mounted to a separate steel frame.
    The Ridgeline is more like a crossover with the rear section of the roof lopped off
    to expose a cargo bed. Currently, pickup trucks come in two size categories:
    full-size and mid-size.
